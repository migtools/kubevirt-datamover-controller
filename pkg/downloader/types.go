// Package downloader implements the datamover pod functionality for
// downloading qcow2 checkpoint chains from object storage and reconstructing
// them into a flat raw disk image for restore.
//
// See pkg/uploader's package doc for the full object storage layout
// (checkpoints/, manifests/, index.json structure) — the downloader reads
// exactly what the uploader writes, using the same pkg/uploader helpers.
//
// # Restore flow
//
//  1. Read the per-VM backup manifest (manifests/<backup>/<ns>-<vm>.json) to
//     get the ordered CheckpointChain (full backup first, incrementals after).
//  2. Read the per-VM index (checkpoints/<ns>/<vm>/index.json) to resolve each
//     checkpoint ID to its CheckpointEntry, and filter Files by TargetVolume
//     (one DataDownload restores one disk/PVC at a time).
//  3. Download each checkpoint's qcow2 file to local scratch storage, in
//     chain order.
//  4. Rebase each qcow2's backing-file pointer onto the local scratch path of
//     its predecessor (the path recorded at backup time won't exist on the
//     restore pod's filesystem), then flatten the chain to a single raw disk
//     image via qemu-img convert.
